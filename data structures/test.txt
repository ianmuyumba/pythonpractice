Harambee Stars beat Tanzania 2-1 in the 2019 CECAFA Senior Challenge Cup playoff to take home Bronze on Thursday, December 19, 2019, at the KCCA Grounds in Kampala, Uganda.

Both sides had fallen to Eritrea and Uganda, respectively, in the semifinals, with the third-place playoff serving a repeat of their Group B encounter.

Kenneth Muguna and Abdallah Hassan were on the scoresheet in the 15th and 36th minute to give Kenya a 2-0 halftime advantage. Gadiel Michael Kamagi pulled one back in the 82nd minute, but it did little to alter the outcome of the match.
