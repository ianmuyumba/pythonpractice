"""
Unit Testing
............

- As you begin to work in a team, you may need to have tests in place
- This way, as you make changes or update your code, you can run your 
test files to make sure that previous code still runs as expected.

-There are several testing tools
	1. pylint: Library that checks code and reports back possible issues
	2. unittest: Built-in library that allows you to test programs and check for desired outputs
